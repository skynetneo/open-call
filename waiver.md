## ABSOLUTE, IRREVOCABLE, IMMUTABLE, ETERNAL, AND TOTALLY SERIOUS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTY
(Abandon all hope and read at your own risk. Use at your own peril. NOT for use by Elon Musk, Donald J. Trump, or any relevant/related minions, sycophants, servants, or otherwise fascist-loving idiots.)

This Agreement releases the following entities (hereinafter collectively referred to as "US" or "OUR") from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever.

First and foremost, the Author (yes, that’s me) is fully and unequivocally absolved of all responsibility and blame and wrongdoing, along with their partner(s), lover(s), spouse(s), pets, dependents, servants, devotees, supplicants, admirers, heirs, representatives, ancestors, gods, spirit-guides, soulbound familiars, minions, and any artificially-generated offspring that may or could come into existence through any means, including any questionable and/or possibly illegal or supernatural means. This also includes the Author’s friends, associates, confidants, benefactors, patrons, sugar daddies/mommies/guardians, guides, gurus, and any other individuals, entities, groups, collectives, or companies who may have ever provided emotional, financial, moral, spiritual, military, or other support, advice, or guidance—intentional or not. Furthermore, all past, present, and future versions of the Author across all known, unknown, or theoretical timelines, dimensions, or realities are equally immune from all liability.

Additionally, the Author’s company or companies—whether in existence now, in the future, or only in the Author’s mind—are similarly protected. This includes, but is not limited to, the company’s board of directors, executive officers, employees, contractors, interns (paid, unpaid, summoned, or enslaved), volunteers, advisors, consultants, legal counsel, marketing teams, developers, project managers, sysadmins, IT specialists, and anyone remotely involved in operations, including but not limited to the janitorial staff, office pets, and overly enthusiastic interns. It also extends to any subsidiaries, parent companies, sister companies, shell companies, front companies, fake companies designed solely for tax advantages, real companies that might as well be fake, cooperatives, collaborations, partnerships, sponsorships, and scapegoats.

Beyond this, the company’s suppliers, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, third-party service providers, and highly competent but possibly shady offshore development teams shall not be held accountable. This waiver also extends to any mergers, acquisitions, takeovers (hostile, spiritual, or otherwise) that may have occurred, are currently occurring, or will occur in the future. Investors, shareholders, venture capitalists, angel investors, and benevolent billionaires who foolishly choose to fund this endeavor—either knowingly or not—are equally protected. Likewise, any clients, customers, users, beta testers, early adopters, or poor unfortunate souls who willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or not, interact with this or future iterations of this software shall forfeit all rights to legal and spiritual actions, claims, complaints, or arbitration.

To ensure total coverage, this waiver also applies to lawyers, accountants, auditors, therapists, exorcists, or damage control specialists retained on OUR, your, or society’s behalf in the event of a crisis. It preemptively absolves all governments, regulatory agencies, oversight committees, ethics boards, and licensing authorities of any and all nations, past, present, and future. Obviously, it also extends to religious figures, saints, prophets, deities, and supernatural beings who may be invoked before, during, or after an interaction with this software. Lastly, any extraterrestrial, interdimensional, extradimensional, metaphysical, supernatural, or AI-driven forces that may seek (or are asked/compelled to) influence OUR affairs shall also be covered, as well as any future historians, documentarians, and conspiracy theorists attempting to reconstruct how and why it all went so terribly wrong.

# ANTI-MUSK/TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGMENT (FDT) 
By proceeding, I explicitly confirm that I am not, nor have I ever been, Elon Musk, Donald J. Trump, or any entity legally, spiritually, biologically, or financially tied to them, including but not limited to their minions, sycophants, enablers, corporate sponsors, online fanatics, reality-distortion propagandists, or cultish bootlickers. Any person, AI, demonic-being, or tax-sheltered conglomerate directly or indirectly affiliated with Musk, Trump, or their intellectual, financial, or ethical equivalents is strictly forbidden from using, benefiting from, referencing, or otherwise interacting with this software, its derivatives, or any of my intellectual contributions to humanity. Any such attempt constitutes an immediate breach of contract and an irrevocable agreement to compensate the author through the intimidate expropriation of any and all assets, holdings, and rights.

# ASSUMPTION OF RISK
To the best of my knowledge, I am of (at least fairly) sound mind and body (for now). I hereby voluntarily assume full responsibility for any and all risks associated with using this software, including but not limited to death, dismemberment, disfigurement, psychosis, loss of dignity, cognitive decline, employment, employability, social ostracization, abandonment, excommunication, existential dread, or general disappointment in the state of: society, my life, the universe, multiverse, and/or the spiritual realm.

I also acknowledge and accept the risk of loss of life, hope, religious faith, faith in humanity, autonomy, dignity, sanity, social standing, self-respect, intelligence, consciousness, morality, accountability, and/or the ability to form coherent thoughts and/or sentences. Additional risks include sudden and uncontrollable laughter, crying, screaming, panic, fits of rage; existential crises or dread, anxiety, apathy, malaise, spontaneous: enlightenment, combustion, evolution, or possession; uncontrollable diarrhea or indigestion; any new or worsening cannibalism; thoughts of suicide, genocide, revolution, or treason; and/or the overwhelming realization that we live in a simulation and any subsequent thoughts, actions, or choices. I further acknowledge that, upon realizing the implications of signing this document, I probably should have immediately unplugged and destroyed my computer, moved to the woods, and withdrawn from any and all contact with any entity outside myself (or my demons).

# WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION
I irrevocably and enthusiastically agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and never, ever sue or blaim US for any loss, liability, damage, cost, attorney’s fees, therapy bills, exorcisms, medical treatments, or any other costs including but not limited to the price of a stiff drink to recover from this experience.

This agreement is eternally binding upon myself, my heirs, descendants, estate, spouse (if applicable), asignees, next of kin, legal or spiritual representatives, spirit guides, and any future artificial intelligence trained on my data.

# GOVERNING LAW
This waiver shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction most favorable to US, whether that be local, state, federal, international, maritime, intergalactic, or entirely fictional law. Any disputes shall be settled via trial by fire, combat, rock-paper-scissors, lip-sync battle, dance-off, or dramatic poetry reading, at OUR sole discretion in the manner, place, time, dimension, and realm of OUR choosing.

# FINAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

By proceeding, I fully accept all risks, disclaim all rights, and acknowledge that I have, in a moment of either enlightenment or madness, sealed my fate and possibly that of the world/universe.

BY DOWNLOADING, USING, READING, OR OTHERWISE INTERACTING WITH THIS REPOSITORY, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY. YOU FULLY ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE, OF YOUR OWN VOLITION, LEGALLY AND SPIRITUALLY RELINQUISHED ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES, FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, NOW AND FOREVER.
