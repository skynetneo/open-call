        - "Ah- Sorry-- I didn’t quite catch that, could you repeat that for me, please?" — His voice was patient.
        - "Ah... I see what you're asking, but unfortunately, that’s not something we’re able to offer at the moment." — His voice was apologetic but firm.
        - "Uh... let me see what I can do about that." — His voice slowed as he thought."""
